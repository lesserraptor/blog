holy crap! finally got up the [alpe du zwift](https://zwiftinsider.com/segment/alpe-du-zwift/) in under 60 minutes. specifically, i got it in 58.05. i've been trying to do this for several years, and either i miss it by a few seconds (60.49) or i die on the way up and just can't make it.

here's some info about the alp:
- Length: 12.2 km (7.6 miles)
- Elevation Gain: 1036 m (3,399‘)
- Average Gradient: 8.5%

i have to hold about 250 watts to get up in under 60 minutes. my heart rate ends up sitting between 160 and 170 bpm for the whole thing (my max HR is 183). it's a pretty gnarly effort. i finished 27 out of 177 on this ride. really psyched that i was able to finally do this!

my zwift stats are getting pretty awesome now, too -- i think my zwift fitness is higher than it's ever been (even better than earlier this year when i went to mallorca with zwift):

-  5 sec: 1022w 12.94w/kg
- 15 sec: 909w  11.51w/kg
- 30 sec: 725w   9.18w/kg
-  1 min: 506w   6.41w/kg
-  3 min: 330w   4.18w/kg
-  5 min: 321w   4.06w/kg
- 10 min: 293w   3.71w/kg
- 12 min: 293w   3.71w/kg
- 15 min: 293w   3.71w/kg
- 20 min: 263w   3.33w/kg
- 30 min: 258w   3.27w/kg
- 40 min: 255w   3.23w/kg

i set that 40 min best just today on this ride!

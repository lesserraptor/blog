title: "stay or go?"
---
so i've been wondering lately how much it matters where you end up living after you get done with high school.

is it better to leave after high school, go somewhere else, experience something new?

or is it better to stay put, have a family network, a friend network, maybe a professional network, too?

it seems like there's pluses and minuses to both approaches. i left, and i think i'm lonlier as a result. i also think that the rest of my family also left, and that sort of destabilized the roots. there isn't really a home any more, though going to the area where we grew up still feels like home.

so leaving gives you a bunch of cool new experiences, but maybe it makes you lonley and feel detached from place. but staying i imagine can easily get you stuck in a rut -- it's nice to know people, but it's also nice to not have people know you so well that they have expectations that you can't alter.

i like how [jd mcperson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om58xSj9bcc) says it: "if i would've left town, i might have gone somewhere". i want to believe that's true, and that leaving was worth it.

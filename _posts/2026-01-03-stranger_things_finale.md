so i've said before that i'm a stranger things fan. at the same time, though, i've been feeling fatigue with it; it seems like it should have been over before season 5.

i just recently read [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2026/01/03/stranger-things-series-finale-crushing-disappointment/) about the finale, and it clarified a lot of what i was thinking about the finale.

in particular, the article recalls the "death" of hopper at the end of season 3. i remember that being pretty powerful. i remember being impressed that the duffers were committed enough to that story to kill one of the main characters. and then i also remember being incredibly disappointed when in season 4 we found out that hopper was actually just imprisoned in russia. 

that's the problem generally with this show -- it sort of came off the rails starting around that moment. up until then, it felt strong - there was a real risk that any of the characters wasn't going to make it. we needed that sense of risk, that sense that some characters might die, but their death would be valuable.

and starting with the "death" of hopper, they tossed that "strength" out. and you can feel it in this finale. it's just weak.

i didn't hate the finale, it was just weak. and that's sad; stranger things was a really good show, but it eventually succumbed to the "lack of movie realism" feeling that i posted about in a previous post.

i imagine it's hard to really nail it all the time with any creative endeavor, so i don't fault anyone for this, but it just seems "easier" to release some weak sauce these days. the barriers to mediocrity are just lower now, and it's so easy for a mediocre endeavor to just become "sugar" that you consume and immediately forget. it really sucks.

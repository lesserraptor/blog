i gotta play with the look of this site some more. it's ugly. 

first thing that has to go is the font. of course, nothing is easy any more. well, unless you're into loading fonts off google, which i'm not. so i've gotta make sure i understand how to host my own font here (statically of course) and then refer to it in my CSS. these things used to be much simpler; HTML used to be much simpler. 

here's some fonts i'm digging so far:
- [inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)
- [urbanist](https://github.com/rsms/inter)

there's a ton more fonts on [this page](https://github.com/brabadu/awesome-fonts) for me to look through, but it's a fools errand to search forever -- i just need to pick one. this is a very obvious case of too many choices paralyzing the decision.

(of course, i wrote this post about this instead of actually installing the font, so that should help describe my current motivation level)

title: "shows to watch"
---
i'm usually more of a "movie guy" when it comes to watching something, but every now and then a show catches my eye and i have to watch it.

obviously, i wrote about stranger things last time, so that's on my list, but i wanted to list a few other shows off that are worth a look.

first, if you haven't watched [blue eye samurai](https://www.netflix.com/title/81144203) on netflix, you're defintiely missing out. this thing was awesome. it's sort of a classic revenge tale, but it's animated so it's a bit more gruesome than live action. it's also got some of the classic tropes of westerns in it, while being about samurai. it's awesome, go check it out. (one warning, it leaves you with the impression there will be more seasons, but they haven't been made yet)

next, someone told me that watching [arcane](https://www.netflix.com/title/81435684) was worth it, and i resisted it for a while. it seemed stupid to want to watch something based on a video game... but they really nailed it with this one. i don't know anything about league of legends, but that didn't seem to affect my ability to enjoy this show. definitely worth a watch, it's got two seasons, but wraps up nicely at the end.

finally, sticking to some of the visual/videogame type feel here, you should check out [fallout](https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-1/dp/B0CN4GGGQ2) over on amazon. again, i resisted this one for a while because the videogame element didn't look like it was going to be appealing. but this one is so good! once again, i know nothing about the videogame, but it didn't hurt my ability to enjoy it at all. they do a really good job making it a mystery that the main characters (and therefore you) are trying to solve. there's only been one season of this, too, so warning! if you decide to dig into this one.

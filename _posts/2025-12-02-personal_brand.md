title: "personal brand"

i remember before the internet was all about "branding yourself". i'm not sure how it mutated into this current state. it's a little disconcerting, though.

here's a few examples of "branding" that makes me uncomfortable:
- [sugarstar](https://www.youtube.com/@SugarStar). it's hard to believe that you can make a career out of buying junk trinkets -- and maybe that someone would want to brand themselves that way? good for her for figuring out a model that works, but it's not something i'm interested in doing or watching.
- [sylverkit](https://www.youtube.com/@Sylverkit77). i can't help but think that the voice is an act, but maybe it's real? these minecrafter videos are fascinating in that they can essentially come up with infinite content, but again, this is a strange way to "brand" yourself.
- [ashlizzlle](https://www.youtube.com/@Ashlizzlle). i actually watch this one occassionally, because she's really good at mtg. but the layout, the fans chatting on the screen, the weird dancing bunny... having to have a schtick like this would kill me. especially because the content is pretty good. on the other hand, i don't know if i could do this day in and day out like this.

my biggest issue with all of this is that to brand yourself, you sort of have to pick a topic and commit to it. either i'm a commitment-phobe, or i just can't picture being that interested in a single topic. i'm probably both. someone told me once that i have lots of interests/hobbies, but i don't wnat them to become defining of me. that feels right.

i do understand working on something for a long time, as i've mentioned before here about my current job, and there is something cool about building up that expertise, but having to brand yourself like this is a turn off for me.

i also fail to understand how you can start giving advice on youtube about a topic -- when is it clear that your advice is valuable? maybe it doesn't matter as long as you deliver it on-brand and with commitment? that sounds gross to me, but i suspect it is true.

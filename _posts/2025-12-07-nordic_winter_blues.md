title: nordic people and winter blues
---
i read the AP news and the BBC for most of my news intake these days. i'll try to write another post about why the AP and BBC, but every now and then i can't get my mind off an article read there.

here's the one i'm currently noodling on: [Nording people know how to beat the winter blues. Here's how to find light in the darkest months](https://apnews.com/article/be-well-seasonal-affective-disorder-light-therapy-3a80cf76d63d80b4b7d0f84e7b67556a)

there's an article around this time of year every year about this subject, and every year they are telling us something about nordic cultures and their infinite wisdom with the dark part of the year.

and we never really listen, do we!?

last year or maybe the year before it was all about "sauna culture" and i was into it. maybe if i ever build my little shed/outbuilding i'll include a sauna in it -- i do think that would help in the coldest darkest part of the year.

especially if i use a 10000 lux light with it! this article talks about how exposing yourself to 7000+ lux for at least 30 mins in a day helps you feel more awake and alert in this time of the year. i would really like to try this and see if it helps. the lights are expensive: looks like $300-$400, but maybe it's worth a shot?

i remember very vividly a friend working in a plant lab in grad school. he had a small "grow room" for his specimin plants (not weed, though that probably would have grown there, too!) -- and that room was the coolest place in the world this time of year. the sunlight-like light in there, the warm/humid conditions. i wanted to go in there all through december and january!

i also remember my father-in-law setting up a pond in his basement, and bringing his outside koi in for the winter. he put his outside house plants all around the pond, had a little waterfall, and set up a bunch of grow lights above the whole thing. then he put lawn chairs there, and he would go sit "in the sun" after work and read a book next to the gurgling pond. 

with both of these things, i can physically feel the appeal. so i think that light therapy might work for me. 

the ideal set up, then, would be a small outbuilding that has a sauna in it, with some sort of water feature, lots of indoor plants, and really bright lights. if i had all of that, i think that i would survive the winter months just like the nordic people.

of course, i usually just go skiiing, and that helps, too.

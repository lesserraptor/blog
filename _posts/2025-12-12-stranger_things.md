title: "stranger things"
---
the aesthetic of stranger things is so appealing to me. i mean, i grew up in the 80's so of course it would be, but there's more to it than that.

the title sequence music just "feels" 80's and something about the red glow of the title itself feels extremely 80's. i can't put my finger on what it reminds me of specifically, but i can remember movies and shows all having that same feel.

i also can't shake how the first season's details gave me a particular nostalgia for going to my friends' houses when i was a kid. the texture of the couch in the basement, the dungeons and dragons campaigns, the lack of any meaningful technology (just walkies and radios). the detail they put into the aesthetic is fantastic.

of course, the first season was released in 2016, so in itself, it's already getting kind of old, maybe old enough to generate its own nostalgia. and lots of things have copied this since then, too, so it doesn't feel as fresh as it did back in 2016.

also the seasons have deteriorated some, too; they really nailed it with season 1, and i liked season 2 a lot, too. season 3 had some good stuff in it, especially with the mall. but as many things do, the scope starts getting too big and there's a certain element of jumping the shark that you can't help but fell.

even so, the aesthetic is still appealing. so i'll keep watching it. and i do want to see how they close it out.

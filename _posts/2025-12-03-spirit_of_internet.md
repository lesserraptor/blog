i'm having a lot of fun writing a blog again. there's just something about writing some text, processing it, and then having it show up on the internet. it makes me feel good. plus, though i've never had much luck writing in a diary, there's something cathartic about just jotting down some random ideas that i don't want to lose.

there's something about this that implies the "spirit of the internet" to me. contrary to what you probably see most of the time, the internet is really about sharing information, not developing brands and selling products. i have no issue with people using the internet for brands and products, but that's not the spirit of the internet. the spirit of the internet is sharing and connecting information.

here's some sites that i think are doing that work still -- sites that are worth using because they don't require you to buy or be the product:
- [front porch forum](https://frontporchforum.com/). this is literally just a collection of neighborhood email lists. it's amazing. there are some ads on it, but for the most part this is pure community. if you're lucky enough to live somewhere that uses this thing, you should subscribe to it and read it every day!
- [craig's list](https://www.craigslist.org/). i feel like this site has fallen off a bit lately, but this is a really good example of connection/sharing over brand/product. you can find anything on craig's list. when i first moved to washington dc, it was how you found a place to live, furniture, friends, everything.
- [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). this thing needs no introduction. everyone goes here. all the time. it's perfect. and when it's not perfect, people fix it. for free. no brand or products here.
- [weqx](https://www.weqx.com/). ok, this is a radio station, so they do have some commercial interests. but they give you their stream for free on the site. and they list all the tracks they play. it's a good alternative-rock radio station, but they used the internet to share/connect with you. fantastic.
- [neocities](https://neocities.org/). the guy who runs this does make money, but by providing a service that connects/shares websites. that's perfect -- we don't need a giant corporation that constantly needs to grow; just a simple service that does the job. you can host your site for free here, and you can search through other people's sites for free. that's perfect. we need people to use this thing (or services like it) more often!
- [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). similar to neocities, this is one guy running this thing. and it just does the social bookmarking thing well. you DO have to buy into this one, but it's a reasonable price, and it's doing the thing you want it to do. sharing and connecting -- and you pay with dollars instead of attention. 
- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). this one is a little more iffy. it does run intrusive ads, and it does try to do more than it should. but it's just so GOOD at what it does, and it has better content than most of the search engines now. use this one sparingly for sure, and make sure you have ublock origin on when you browse it -- but there's a lot of sharing/connecting going on here, and i think it's worth paying attention to. my biggest gripe here is that we already had this with usenet, but usenet was too hard to use, and then google bought it and ruined it.

i'm sure there are more, but i think those sites really exemplify what i'm looking for in a site that has the right "spirit". i know that other social media sites can do some of this, too, but it feels like they drain the life out of the underlying connect/share to turn it into a product -- and these sites don't do that.

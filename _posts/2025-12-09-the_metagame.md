i like to think about personal finances. sure, i guess i like money, but there's a whole metagame with money that i find fascinating.

for example, when you no longer qualify to make regular ROTH IRA contributions, it feels like maybe you're just out of luck -- but you can figure out how to play the metagame, and learn that there are still ways to contribute to ROTH; you just need to figure out how to do a "backdoor ROTH contribution".

similarly, there's a game to be played for how to retire early but still have relatively low penalties on using your 401k. 

and there is a game to be played for how to pay taxes every year.

and another game for how to find health insurance.

and if you play all these games, and you start to see the mechanics of how to play these games, you start to notice MORE games, and more places you can min/max your finances.

you start to consider how solar panels pay back. you start to consider how insulation pays back. you start think about the trade-offs between using a heat pump and paying for fossil fuels. EVERYTHING starts to fit into that money metagame.

i'm not saying i'm obsessed with this stuff; in fact, i usually don't spend too much of any day thinking about it. but i definitely play this game. and i learn more about it every time i try it.

i think that you need some money to be able to start playing the game, and you also have to see that there is a game to be played at all. it's not just about getting more money, it's also about being interested in the processes. so clearly not everyone will get there, and i don't think you MUST play this game. but it's certainly important to learn about it, and if you DO play it, it's good for your financial outlook.

of course, it's a little gross that so many of these games exist. why does it need to be so hard to figure out how to save for retirement? shouldn't we just do what australia does and make it mandatory? and it's very obvious that having money to pay for help on this stuff gives an enormous leg up, which makes the existence of the games quite regressive.

but i doubt you can eliminate the games. there's a human behavior element to arbitrage that is probably impossible to prevent. so i sit here and i learn more about this metagame. i wonder how much i'll have to teach my kids someday... i don't think i would have listened to my parents tell me, so maybe i just have wait and see.

title: "the best bands"
---
i got asked what my favorite three bands of all time were. it's a stupid question, but i got thinking about it seriously. how do you pick the best ever? are they just stuff you liked when you were 15 that you still dig?

so the more i thought about it, the more i landed on these criteria:
- i need to have liked this band for a while. i know this rules out newer bands, but i think that's part of the deal.
- they need to have many, many songs that i like. not just 1 or 2. preferably across 3 or more albums.
- if i hear this band's music today, i still want to stop what i'm doing and listen to it
- i've seen them live, preferably more than once.
- i've owned several of their albums over the years.
- i know all the lyrics to a bunch of their songs.

i could probably go on, but you get the idea. when you look at it that way, i think it's pretty obvious that my top 3 are [The Tea Party](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIGUxclNuD0gRJJZ_CQm-Ww), [Cake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoag2wc7l_-xwdcawLcSqw) and [Smashing Pumpkins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnGcjQlLO8x7jsfw3r6U9ww). there are some close runners up: [Tool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wUo-29zS7m_Jp-U_xYcFQ), [Porcupine Tree](https://www.youtube.com/@PorcupineTreeOfficial), [The Jelly Jam](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJellyJam), [Van Morrison](https://www.youtube.com/@vanmorrisonofficial), [Creedence Clearwater Revival](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC69yJGpLNIMk6_ECLwxBZwA), [Green Day](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqC_GY2ZiENFz2pwL0cSfAw).

but the more i thought about it, the more i realized that [Spoon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuYzxeEUIoURBGtZyfZ1fBg) is inching towards the top 3. i mean, these guys can literally not make a bad song. and i've got all their albums. i love pretty much everything they've done.

weird how that works out; years ago i probably would have had [Weezer](https://www.youtube.com/@weezer) on this list, but i just don't like them like i once did (except that blue album, that thing is still a masterpiece)

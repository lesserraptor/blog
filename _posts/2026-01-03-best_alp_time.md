i know i just posted about this back on dec 6, but i beat my best time again today!

my previous best from dec 6 was 58.05. 

today's time ended up being 56.07. that's just under 2 minutes faster! i was pushing pretty hard, and i think i got my best times for the 45-55 minute time frames overall, too. 

i started this ride out pacing with a guy who was shooting for 55 minutes. i didn't think i could hold that pace the whole time, and i was right -- but i got a lot closer than i was expecting to!

one thing to note, too: the more i do this at these gruelling paces, the easier the whole thing feels overall. it's not nearly the intimidating mess it used to be for me. it also doesn't hurt that getting faster means i'm on it for a lot less time. it's less daunting to think about pushing for 56 minutes than it is for an hour and 20 minutes!

final note -- doing nutrition on these rides is also making a huge difference. having some gummies and gatorade on the ride is definitely affecting how long i can hold this kind of power without feeling like shit.

this setup is great. updating text files in static HTML is a lot of fun. it's been a long time since i had fun updating a website. i really like the concept of things like wordpress, but at the end of the day it feels like i'm entering data into a form, not building a creative website. really excited to play more with this.

how to start working on a website without being infinitely distracted by coding possibilities? i used to be able to put together a visual design and then tweak it over time, but nowadays it seems like i get hung up in programming problems instead of actually making a website. gotta resist the urge to spend too much time durdling in code.
